Following his graduation from North Carolina State University with a BA in Business Management, he joined Sprint where he initially served as an Outside Plant Engineer charged with the deployment of networking and computer equipment. He later served in a series of senior engineering, operational and management positions. He then moved into a Data Sales manager position charged with leading a team in the design, proposal, and implementation of voice, data and video projects. In this capacity, he engineered complex systems including voice, structured wiring, fiber optics, ATM, SONET, Ethernet, token-ring, and outside plant systems.

Mr. Herron has consulted extensively with business leaders and educators, as well as local and state government officials in the deployment of voice, video, and data technologies. Some of his projects included the North Carolina Information Highway and a multimillion dollar voice and data network solution for North Carolina-based Lowe’s Hardware. Later, as an Operations Manager, he was responsible for all customer services, engineering services, project management and implementation services for central North Carolina.

Mr. Herron left Sprint in 1999 to serve as the Director–Sales and Engineering Services for a startup public safety systems integrator, where he designed solutions for some of our nation’s most mission-critical sites. His projects included the Kennedy Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as several Department of Energy sites.

He most recently founded Paradox Capital, a social impact venture fund focused on for-profit social good companies.  His experience in business and politics will help bridge the paradox between capitalism and social consciousness. 

Over the last 25 years, Dowd has been an active entrepreneur in Austin, Texas founding three companies which have been highly successful including Vianovo and Public Strategies, all of which he sold his interests in to pursue other endeavors. 

Dowd has worked both sides of the aisle, but now considers himself a diehard Independent.  Dowd’s political work includes serving as the chief strategist on two winning re-election efforts – for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 and for President George W. Bush in 2004. His innovative approach on the 2004 campaign led the bi-partisan American Association of Political Consultants to name him Strategist of the Year.

In the 1980s and 1990s, he advised a wide variety of political clients including helping former Democrat Texas Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock win election and re-election. He has also worked as a member of Democrat U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen's staff, and has worked on the staffs of two Democratic Congressmen.

Dowd currently serves as a special correspondent and analyst for ABC News where he appears on This Week, Good Morning America, and Nightline, and writes a regular column for various publications. Dowd covers not only politics but cultural, economic, and spiritual trends as well.  He has served on the boards of various non-profit entities including Seton Family of Hospitals, a Catholic nonprofit health system in Texas.  He was adviser to Bono at the One Campaign, and to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  He has taught seminars at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and the University of Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs.

Anderson co-founded Space Adventures in 1997 with several former astronauts and leading visionaries from the aerospace, adventure travel, and entertainment industries.

Anderson's vision is to open the space frontier to private citizens, and to develop and utilize space resources for the benefit of people on Earth. He has been and remains an outspoken advocate of commercial space transportation, private space exploration, and space tourism.

After founding the company in 2010 with two partners, Dave has led the brand through countless pivotal achievements, including the launch of two apps, creating a proprietary heart rate monitor with strategically chosen partners and signing celebrity brand ambassadors. In addition, Dave facilitated Orangetheory Fitness‘ exponential growth, and expanded the brand worldwide, with studios now open in several countries. The scientifically backed fitness franchise continues its rapid expansion with no end in sight under Dave’s leadership.

Prior to founding Orangetheory Fitness, Dave started out in the wellness industry with Massage Envy. With his business acumen and unwavering perseverance, he helped grow the franchise from 25 to 800 locations. After that much success, most people would likely consider retirement, but Dave wanted a new challenge. He joined European Wax Center as a consultant (and eventually as an area representative and franchisee) and helped build an area representative network at a time when there were only 4 family owned locations. With the area representative network that Dave and his partner helped build, European Wax Center expanded the concept from 4 to over 550 locations in less than 9 years.

A health nut since his youth, Dave has tried almost every fitness fad, including submerging himself in ice. He is a walking encyclopedia on nutrition, weight loss and overall wellness, and helps others around the office stick to their fitness goals, inspiring his team to never give up. In addition, Dave regularly appears on TV to reach a larger audience and speak about the fitness industry. Dave is a true visionary in today’s franchise business realm.

He was born in Wichita, KS- the son of an electrical engineer and an art teacher. He graduated from the University of Kansas the year Internet Explorer 1.0 was released. 

A self-taught programmer, David started by writing apps for the PalmOS. To support this app, he learned how to build websites. Once he starting building websites, he started learning how to promote them. This all came naturally to him, as the son of an engineer.

In the meantime, David was doing some writing. His first ""professional"" writing was for the University Daily Kansan as an opinion columnist. After college, he continued to write, occasionally, for periodicals and local newspapers. In his career, David started dabbling with marketing. All this creativity came from his mother's influence, as an art teacher.

In 2008 David got his first job in online marketing. The agency hired him after taking some advice from Matt Cutts. Cutts suggested they hire someone who ""knew a little about development, but wasn't a developer; and knew a little about marketing, but wasn't a marketer."" This described David perfectly. 

After a few years at that agency, David moved-on to Ephircon Web Marketing, as an early employee. There he was entrusted with Enterprise-level clients. When Ephircon was purchased by Straight North, David was promoted to a Director of Marketing Services, where he managed his own clients and a team of account managers. 

In 2015 David started his own internet marketing consultancy, Reliable Acorn, LLC.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/david-zimmerman-4,BREAK,SEO,Consulting,BREAK

Michael Mamas is a thought leader in the areas of spirituality and personal development, with 35 years of teaching experience (including the U.S., India, Europe, and Canada). He helps people develop a deeper understanding and more comprehensive outlook by providing a bridge between the abstract and the concrete, the Eastern and the Western, and the ancient and modern. Dr. Mamas is also the founder and CEO of The Center of Rational Spirituality.
 
Mount Soma is a 448-acre Vedic community in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Envisioned and founded by Dr. Michael Mamas, Mount Soma promotes total well-being through the utilization of Vedic technology, an applied science based upon the fundamental principles of nature. A prime illustration of this is Sri Somesvara Temple, completed in 2011, that amplifies the natural coherence and harmony found at the base of existence.  Under Michael Mamas' leadership, Mount Soma is a spiritual destination for visitors from around the world, drawing over 15,000 people in 2014 alone.
 
Dr. Michael Mamas has been teaching internationally for over 35 years, and offers classes, lectures, and meditation retreats at Mount Soma. His rational approach to spirituality encourages students of all religions and creeds to move beyond their current perspectives, and find the place inside themselves which is the source of all understanding. He teaches discernment as opposed to judgment, multiple realities as opposed to one way, and resting into your true nature as opposed to trying to be better. By combining Surya Ram Meditation, personal process, and Knowledge based on the nature of existence, Michael Mamas' teachings offer people from all faiths a path to true happiness, successful relationships, wise business endeavors, and general fulfillment in all areas of life. 
 
In 2007, Michael Mamas was awarded the title Adhyatm Vidhya Visharad—Master of the Highest Spiritual Knowledge, the deepest awakening of the Self—from the Sanskrit College at the University of Gujarat, in India. He is the only person from the West to have been awarded this appellation.

I have spent my entire professional and personal life stimulating both sides of my brain to the point where I have pursued advanced degrees and career positions that exploit my self-proclaimed mastering of both artistic expression and technical know-how. 

My professional career has taken me from developing black-ops military tech and NASA/space borne avionics, through gaming including directing the NCAA / Madden series of games for EA Sports, then ultimately to today where I have spent 13 years with my business partners creating nuMedia Innovations and the patented technologies behind it.

My educational background spans degrees and post-graduate education in electrical engineering, computer science, multimedia technologies, advanced 3D animation and digital audio.
	
My professional experiences have only been trumped by the pure luck I enjoy in having a wonderful wife of 22 years and two incredibly talented and respectful daughters. I also indulge other passions as a general aviation pilot, a devoted fan of the genius of Walt Disney and the legacy he created, attempting to find time to enjoy the 7 musical instruments I attempt to play, and most of all enjoying the arts, dance and theater with an appreciation that only living with the three ladies in my life have brought out in me.

The Alliance’s focus on five areas of giving—health, education, environment, poverty, and world relations—is mirrored in Leonard’s past.  He has made major gifts to Duke University Medical Center and the Duke Comprehensive Cancer and Heart Centers, to the Lineberger Cancer Center at UNC Chapel Hill, to the Cardiac Rehabilitation program at Moses Cone Hospital, and had a leadership position at the Greensboro Cardiac Rehabilitation Program.  In 2004, Leonard and Tobee built the new building for the Women’s Resource Center in Greensboro and remain active and enthusiastic supporters of all of its programs.

His gifts to education have been similarly generous.  He created scholarships for residents of Guilford County to attend North Carolina colleges and universities, and was a founding donor of Elon University Law School.  Critically, in partnership with the Kellogg Foundation, Leonard helped create the Center for Organizational Leadership, a philanthropic studies program (which was one of first nationally to educate non-profit executives).

Leonard has given not only of his wealth, but also of his time and expertise, taking on leadership positions in many organizations and campaigns such as the Greater Greensboro United Way DeToqueville Society, and as a Core Member of ACTION Greensboro, a nonprofit dedicated to improving public education, revitalization of downtown Greensboro, and leveraging economic development.

In recognition of his leadership, Leonard was recognized by the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce with its Thomas Z Osborne Citizen of the Year Award and the Benjamin Cone, Sr. Leadership Award.  In 1999, he received an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from the Jewish Theological Seminary.

His past experience includes several successful business ventures and start up companies. His first job out of college was working with RCA New Products Division introducing, creating and developing the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) security business. Mr.  Nalven traveled the world developing and implementing CCTV components at a time when the USA was the innovator and world leader in electronic sales abroad. He traveled extensively and ended up living and working in China for seven years developing product to be sold worldwide. When RCA sold their CCTV division to Philips Inc., he continued on to supply Phillips with equipment of his own design. That same division is now owned by BOSCH Security Systems and continues to sell to this day, systems based on his original work with RCA and Phillips Inc.

In the mid 90s, Mr. Nalven started a new company also called MultiVision and began a collaboration with a company called CREE. CREE was a North Carolina high tech electronics company that was one of the original inventors of the blue LED light. This led Mr. Nalven to the start a company that designed and developed video processing for displays that were made from LED lighting technology. With his product, a video source such as a camera or TV feed could be displayed on an LED screen. His customers became CREE, Siemens and SACO. He later joined with SACO to start Smartvision because they were better able to finance jobs and had a large manufacturing facility. Smartvision had a very strong start supplying various sizes of LED video displays to U2, the Baltimore Ravens, Celine Dion, NASDAQ and many many more.

Due to the cost of print these days, I quickly changed industries and went in the direction of web design. Utilizing best practices in HTML design and CSS layouts I was able to develop websites that were appealing to end users. 

In 2010, I enhanced my web skills with LAMP based programming and then furthered my expertise to HTML5 and CSS3 early in 2012 which enables me to build cross-browser websites that are not only browser friendly but also mobile.

My goals for 2014, are to work with a handful of selected start-ups in the Research Triangle Park of North Carolina. I want to be able to help people learn about what it takes to succeed online and help them build successful revenue streams. Anyone can have an idea or a passion but unless they can successfully make a profit doing so the idea can't grow. 

I have always enjoyed the energy and passion that people have when they devote themselves to an idea and the amount their willing to risk to make it a reality. I have always been a risk-taker myself moving to North Carolina from Ohio because of the lack of opportunities there, knowing only 3 people in North Carolina when I moved and then developing a new network of entrepreneurs and other like-minded individuals by interacting with local networking programs, accelerators and start-up groups.
