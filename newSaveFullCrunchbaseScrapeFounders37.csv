Having held top positions in mortgage and real estate before Movement, Toby is familiar with the gap in the industry where people – both customers and employees – are concerned. In 2008, he partnered with CEO Casey Crawford to create Movement to fill that gap.

Toby leads with a passion for servant leadership, excellence in customer service and coaching and encouraging leaders as a certified Maxwell coach. Drawing from his military background, it was Toby who established Movement’s standard-shattering processing goals of 6-hour underwriting and 7-day processing by asking seasoned underwriters how quickly a quality loan can be completed, rather than following the laissez-faire approach of most lending institutions.

In Toby’s view, Movement should set such a high standard that employees of any industry are drawn to the workplace culture and the service level so high that competitors are compelled to improve their own. These are the convictions he puts to work each day from Virginia Beach, VA, the place he and his wife call home.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/william-toby-harris
6132e15047f14987a4843d81dadb6591,Casey,Crawford,,"A glance at his resume and you may think to Movement’s CEO, Casey Crawford, greatness lies in achievements like NFL Super Bowl champion, founder and CEO of a multibillion dollar mortgage company, and becoming a sought-after media guest whose appearances span CNBC’s Squawk Box, Bloomberg and Fox News with print features in The Wall Street Journal and TIME Magazine. 

There's no doubt the 2015 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year is ambitious. But what truly drives him is not a championship ring or reaching the top of the corporate ladder. It’s meeting others’ needs.

As a child, Casey watched his father and grandfather use entrepreneurship as outreach. Whether the need was material, employment, friendship or a good example, he saw how business could be used to meet it. 

Following his football days during a stint in real estate, Casey became alarmed by glaring inadequacies within the lending industry. The greed and corruption among leadership, the lack of value and care toward employees, and the inattentiveness toward community problems seemed like wide open opportunities.

Casey’s response? Movement Mortgage, established in 2008 on the Christian values he shares with co-founder Toby Harris. Movement was developed as a hope-filled paradox to a dismal reality, with a mission to be a Movement of Change in our Industry, Corporate Cultures and Communities.

Today, the company employs more than 4,500 and has over 650 locations in all 50 states. In 2017, Movement ranked among the top 10 purchase lenders by financing 1 in every 60 home purchases in the country, totaling more than $13 billion in originations. As prosperity increases, so does the overflow into people’s lives. The non-profit Movement Foundation has invested more than $25 million toward community improvement and meeting the needs of the underserved around the globe.

Co-founded my first company as a high school senior at the North Carolina School of Science & Mathematics, took an indefinite leave of absence from Stanford, and helped grow Motricity to more than $100 million in annual revenues and 500 employees. Motricity's platform delivered more than $3 billion of ringtones and games to mobile phones. Investors included NEA, TCV, Carl Icahn, Noro-Moseley Partners, and Wakefield Group. Motricity successfully completed a $50 million IPO co-led by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and achieved a market capitalization as high as $1.25 billion. 

Founded my second start-up, Appia, in 2008 and raised $30 million in venture capital from investors including Venrock, Trident Capital, Eric Schmidt’s TomorrowVentures, Relay Ventures, Noro-Moseley Partners, and Wakefield Group. Appia's mobile user acquisition network for Android & iOS delivered more than 100 million app installs for hundreds of advertisers, including 60 of the top 100 grossing apps on the App Store and Google Play. Appia was acquired by Digital Turbine (Nasdaq: APPS) in March 2015 for approximately $100 million.

Founded my third start-up, Sift, in 2015 around the idea that the unique set of apps each of us has installed on our smartphones is like a digital fingerprint of who we are and our interests. Sift is backed by $3.25 million in capital from investors including Wakefield Group, Piedmont Capital, Alerion Ventures, and IDEA Fund Partners.

A self-taught programmer, David started by writing apps for the PalmOS. To support this app, he learned how to build websites. Once he starting building websites, he started learning how to promote them. This all came naturally to him, as the son of an engineer.

In the meantime, David was doing some writing. His first ""professional"" writing was for the University Daily Kansan as an opinion columnist. After college, he continued to write, occasionally, for periodicals and local newspapers. In his career, David started dabbling with marketing. All this creativity came from his mother's influence, as an art teacher.

In 2008 David got his first job in online marketing. The agency hired him after taking some advice from Matt Cutts. Cutts suggested they hire someone who ""knew a little about development, but wasn't a developer; and knew a little about marketing, but wasn't a marketer."" This described David perfectly. 

After a few years at that agency, David moved-on to Ephircon Web Marketing, as an early employee. There he was entrusted with Enterprise-level clients. When Ephircon was purchased by Straight North, David was promoted to a Director of Marketing Services, where he managed his own clients and a team of account managers.

His past experience includes several successful business ventures and start up companies. His first job out of college was working with RCA New Products Division introducing, creating and developing the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) security business. Mr.  Nalven traveled the world developing and implementing CCTV components at a time when the USA was the innovator and world leader in electronic sales abroad. He traveled extensively and ended up living and working in China for seven years developing product to be sold worldwide. When RCA sold their CCTV division to Philips Inc., he continued on to supply Phillips with equipment of his own design. That same division is now owned by BOSCH Security Systems and continues to sell to this day, systems based on his original work with RCA and Phillips Inc.

In the mid 90s, Mr. Nalven started a new company also called MultiVision and began a collaboration with a company called CREE. CREE was a North Carolina high tech electronics company that was one of the original inventors of the blue LED light. This led Mr. Nalven to the start a company that designed and developed video processing for displays that were made from LED lighting technology. With his product, a video source such as a camera or TV feed could be displayed on an LED screen. His customers became CREE, Siemens and SACO. He later joined with SACO to start Smartvision because they were better able to finance jobs and had a large manufacturing facility. Smartvision had a very strong start supplying various sizes of LED video displays to U2, the Baltimore Ravens, Celine Dion, NASDAQ and many many more.

A three-time entrepreneur, Todd has experienced the highs and lows of running fast-growth technology companies. A proficient coder by age 14, he spent his teen years working as a database designer and software architect for MBNA Bank in Delaware. By graduation from Carnegie Mellon University, he’d invented a data integration product, co-founded Cerebellum Software, and raised seed capital. Cerebellum went on to raise $17 million in institutional capital and hire 65 people, only to shut down when funding dried up during the dotcom era. A role as vice president of product development at TogetherSoft brought Todd to Raleigh, where he eventually started 6th Sense Analytics, which he sold to Rally Software. The inspiration for Pendo came as Todd led the product team at Rally. With no product usage data available, he struggled to decide which of the dozens of feature requests that hit his desk each week were worth the investment of time and capital. After Rally’s IPO, he teamed up with fellow product leaders and technologists from Red Hat, Cisco and Google to launch Pendo in October 2013. The company has since raised $56 million in venture capital, landed more than 500 customers and now employs 170 people across offices in Raleigh, San Francisco, New York and Yakum, Israel. It was named a Top 50 U.S. Startup by LinkedIn in 2017.


Todd prides himself on his product background, and the knowledge, experience and empathy it lends to customers of Pendo. He frequently speaks at industry events on topics like Agile software development, product management, startup fundraising and entrepreneurship.

In this role, she focuses on the company's short-term and long-term futures, including strategic planning, annual budgeting, mergers and acquisitions, banking relationships, setting big-picture product direction, and sourcing products from vendors worldwide.
While Ting worked as a computer programmer for the Virginia State Health Department in the early 1990s, her parents decided to retire early, immigrating to the United States to be closer to their children. In an effort to launch a second career for her parents, Ting wanted to create a business that they could manage. When she was introduced to a couple who made decorative flags in their home, that business idea was born. In 1993, Ting started Evergreen Enterprises with her brother James and her parents in the garage of their suburban Virginia home. Today the company is the nation's largest flag designer and wholesaler, producing millions of flags each year along with over 12,000 other home and garden decor products.
Since that launch, Ting has had the challenge and opportunity to work within every area of the business including customer service, orders, shipping, collections, and much more. This diversity has allowed for a deep foundation of understanding of every aspect of Evergreen Enterprises. As the business has grown, Ting has stayed dedicated to examining what possibilities the future holds, never being satisfied with the status quo. In this spirit, Evergreen has achieved impressive sales growth each year since its inception and has established itself as a leader in the highly competitive home and garden decor business.
Ting's dedication to knowledge was instilled in her from early childhood, and was demonstrated by her decision to attend Fudan University in China in 1984. Two years later, taking the opportunity to become an international student at Old Dominion University, she came to the United States, where she earned her B. S. and M. S. in computer science by 1989.  Now living in the rolling green hills of Goochland, Virginia with her husband and two children, Ting is heavily involved with the Organization of Chinese Americans, various philanthropic efforts, and the Maggie Walker Governor's School, where both of her children have attended. In her free time, Ting takes pleasure in reading, traveling, and trend shopping.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/ting-xu
