Some might today assume, like Athena was said to have sprung whole from the head of Zeus, that Sykes sprang wholly prepared upon the world of pipes. The truth, however, is that he didn't have any idea what he was getting into. Mostly. He had not then ever written a line of code, and he had no inkling as to how to run a business, even one that was just two guys and a small rented warehouse space in Tennessee. What he did have from his part-time job at a local tobacco shop was an inkling of the sort that in hindsight others would call insight: technology, particularly the World Wide Web, could revolutionize pipe and tobacco retail just as it was transforming so many other industries. Of equal importance was Sykes's growing interest in pipes as works of functional art that deserved critical discussion. This interest was good enough to get things started; the knowledge needed to run a successful business would develop over time as it does for most of us in our 20s: by doing with enthusiasm. So it was with enthusiasm and two convictions--that the pipe business needed technology and that pipes were serious and beautiful things--that Sykes laid the foundation for what Smokingpipes.com would eventually become. This trinity still largely defines his role in the company today where his primary responsibilities include overseeing finances, operations, and software development, as well as vendor relationships and sales, all things that he has learned a little about in the ensuing years. But even as time has carried on and the company has grown, Sykes is still never more passionate than when working directly with, or teaching others about, pipes.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/sykes-wilford,E-Commerce Platforms,E-Commerce,Wholesale,,,,,

In her first book, Creating a World of Difference, Tana shares her philosophy and approach to business, which is to create a culture of engagement that results in high performance. The Greene Group Foundation sets aside a portion of corporate profits to benefit employees of client companies. This cause has become a driving force for cultural excellence.

Tana speaks to audiences not only about her approach to business, but her own life story and experience with domestic violence. As a member of the Steering Committee to raise money for a new women’s shelter in Charlotte, she advocates on behalf of victims of domestic violence.

When we’ve saved a company millions and I get an email of thanks from the CFO, that good feeling is an injection of energy that powers me through my day and makes me want to help everyone I can. I also know that each dollar we put back on a shipper’s bottom line goes towards creating more jobs, which stimulates the economy, which helps keep this country great!

Here at First Flight Solutions, I love seeing our people develop into the future leaders of the company and the community in which we live and work. This is why I am excited by what we do and why each day doesn’t feel like work.

Prior to this, I worked in the parcel industry for 20 years with UPS®, eventually serving as senior sales manager for both Carolinas. While there, I earned many accolades, and envisioned starting my own company in which I could use my experience to help companies and people like the CFOs who thank me for saving them millions. In 2011 Travis and I made that dream come true.

In the early days of my career, I served in the Marine Corps before joining the North Carolina Highway Patrol, and then while at UPS, I earned a BSc in Business at La Salle University. All of this imbued me with the courage and determination and fortitude to not quit until the game is won.

My life has been lived on the principle of doing what you say you are going to do. At FFS we say we will get our clients the biggest savings and the best logistics agreements that are possible to get — so that’s what we do!",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/b-keith-byrd-first-flight-solutions,Freight Service,Delivery,Logistics,Transportation,Consulting,,,

Graduating in 1998 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, he quickly excelled in the telecommunications field. 

His journey to helping Bold Construction become one of the area’s premier builders began in 2003 when a business opportunity with ​a ​close friend and fellow entrepreneur opened up. After relocating his family to Chapel Hill, Jason became an integral part of the development and building company’s ownership leading the team in client relationships, project management, and business development. 

Jason can be found spending time with his wife, Susan, and their two children, Carter and Tatum,​ playing a round of golf or volunteering with local nonprofits. As a part of the ‘Fuel Up’ program, he has helped to provide children with nutritional meals during the weekends and school breaks, when access to school meals is not available. When asked about his motivations and drive, Jason responds that he wants to help each child have the same opportunities as his own children have – access to proper nutrition, character building activities, and fun, memorable activities. 

Jason has also been an active member of University Presbyterian Church since 2003 where he has served as a youth advisor and on the board of trustees in the past and currently serves on the building committee during the church’s expansion project. Not only does Jason reside in the Chatham County, Chapel Hill area, but he has also invested his time, business interests, and energy into the continued growth of the local economy making Chatham County one of the best places to call home.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/jason-dell-bold-construction,Building Material,Home Improvement,Smart Building,Infrastructure,Construction,,,

He has over 15 years of extensive experience in large pharma, biotechnology, and specialty pharma and an established track record of clinical, regulatory, and entrepreneurial success within the pharmaceutical industry.

Dr. Banks received his Ph.D., in protein biochemistry from Washington State University and transitioned to pharmaceutical drug development following a post-doctoral appointment at NIH.  The first compound worked on in his pharmaceutical career was HUMIRA® (adalimumab) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and, during his work at Salix Pharmaceuticals, he led the Xifaxan® (rifaximin) clinical program that won FDA approval for the Hepatic Encephalopathy indication.

He brings C-level and drug development expertise to Nuventra’s clients from his work as a clinical pharmacology/PK/PD consultant and corporate R&D adviser to over 250 companies that range from venture-backed, start-up biotech companies through large multinational pharmaceutical companies.  He has valuable insight into business and R&D operations as well as R&D strategies for pharma/biotech companies with compounds (small molecule and biologics) across all stages of drug development (discovery through IND, early phase through late phase clinical development, and marketing authorizations [NDA/BLA/MAA] through post-approval commitments).

Dr. Banks is also the co-founder of a virtual drug development company (1st Order Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) that purchased a small molecule potassium channel opener for Kv7 (KCNQ) ion channels for central nervous system hyperexcitability-related disorders in neurology and pain.  In 2017, the following was announced “Xenon Expands Ion Channel Neurology Pipeline with Acquisition of New Potassium Channel Modulator for the Treatment of Epilepsy,”giving Dr. Banks insight into start-up pharmaceutical and biotech companies seeking funding and development partners while progressing drug development in parallel.

With Dr. Banks’ track record of drug development and entrepreneurial success in the pharmaceutical industry, he brings unique insight into success strategies and pitfalls for pharmaceutical/biotech companies supported by Nuventra.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/geoffrey-banks,Pharmaceutical,Consulting,,,,,,
