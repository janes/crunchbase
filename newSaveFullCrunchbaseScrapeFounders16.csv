Having held top positions in mortgage and real estate before Movement, Toby is familiar with the gap in the industry where people – both customers and employees – are concerned. In 2008, he partnered with CEO Casey Crawford to create Movement to fill that gap.

Toby leads with a passion for servant leadership, excellence in customer service and coaching and encouraging leaders as a certified Maxwell coach. Drawing from his military background, it was Toby who established Movement’s standard-shattering processing goals of 6-hour underwriting and 7-day processing by asking seasoned underwriters how quickly a quality loan can be completed, rather than following the laissez-faire approach of most lending institutions.

In Toby’s view, Movement should set such a high standard that employees of any industry are drawn to the workplace culture and the service level so high that competitors are compelled to improve their own. These are the convictions he puts to work each day from Virginia Beach, VA, the place he and his wife call home.",https://api.crunchbase.com/v3.1/people/william-toby-harris
6132e15047f14987a4843d81dadb6591,Casey,Crawford,,"A glance at his resume and you may think to Movement’s CEO, Casey Crawford, greatness lies in achievements like NFL Super Bowl champion, founder and CEO of a multibillion dollar mortgage company, and becoming a sought-after media guest whose appearances span CNBC’s Squawk Box, Bloomberg and Fox News with print features in The Wall Street Journal and TIME Magazine. 

There's no doubt the 2015 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year is ambitious. But what truly drives him is not a championship ring or reaching the top of the corporate ladder. It’s meeting others’ needs.

As a child, Casey watched his father and grandfather use entrepreneurship as outreach. Whether the need was material, employment, friendship or a good example, he saw how business could be used to meet it. 

Following his football days during a stint in real estate, Casey became alarmed by glaring inadequacies within the lending industry. The greed and corruption among leadership, the lack of value and care toward employees, and the inattentiveness toward community problems seemed like wide open opportunities.

Casey’s response? Movement Mortgage, established in 2008 on the Christian values he shares with co-founder Toby Harris. Movement was developed as a hope-filled paradox to a dismal reality, with a mission to be a Movement of Change in our Industry, Corporate Cultures and Communities.

Today, the company employs more than 4,500 and has over 650 locations in all 50 states. In 2017, Movement ranked among the top 10 purchase lenders by financing 1 in every 60 home purchases in the country, totaling more than $13 billion in originations. As prosperity increases, so does the overflow into people’s lives. The non-profit Movement Foundation has invested more than $25 million toward community improvement and meeting the needs of the underserved around the globe.
